python-altinstall for RHEL/CentOS 7

You need to copy the SPEC that you would like to build and the script to a directory with enough free space in your build host (/tmp might not be big enough). Then

chmod +x build_rpms.sh
./build_rpms.sh

the source RPM will end up in rpmbuild/SRPMS and the binary one in rpmbuild/RPMS
